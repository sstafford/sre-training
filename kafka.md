# Kafka Training
[Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/)
is a streaming platform that can be quite useful for providing
a highly available infrastructure for observability data and event
information.  Because Kafka is widely supported by many open source
projects as an input and output channel for message data, it is often
easy to deploy into an infrastructure with minimal investment. 
The multiple producer/consumer model allows multiple applications to
read and write data, ensuring a loose coupling between applications
while still ensuring high availability and high throughput.

## Overview Training by Stephane Maarek
Stephane Maarek is a solutions architect and consultant in the areas of
Kafka and AWS.  He has produced training material on Udemy and posts
much of the introductory videos on YouTube.  Since this training plan
is meant to provide only a general overview of Kafka, the YouTube
videos will be sufficient.  If additional depth is required, the full
training videos are available on the O'Reilly Online site.

Here are the list of training videos:

* [Apache Kafka in 5 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzPXRmVHMxI) (5 minutes)
* [Kafka Topics, Partitions and Offsets Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q1IjK5jjyU) (7 minutes)

## Alternate Overview Training by Tim Berglund
Tim Berglund is a Director of Developer Advocacy at Confluent.
He is currently the public face for Confluent at most training and
conference events.  Although he is a good speaker, I find his videos
somewhat fast paced for beginners which is why I provided this YouTube
playlist as an alternate training path in case the primary training
material was not satisfactory. 

The following YouTube playlist contains a series of videos:

* [Apache Kafka Fundamentals](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLa7VYi0yPIH2PelhRHoFR5iQgflg-y6JA) (90 Minutes)

## Advanced Training
The advanced training materials offer longer and more in-depth
videos on Kafka and related topics.
