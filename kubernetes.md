# Kubernetes Training

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) is a platform for for deploying and managing containerized
applications.  Many cloud vendors such as Amazon, Google, and Microsoft provide Kubernetes as a
service, allowing software to be deployed in a consistent way across multiple environments.  It
is also possible to deploy Kubernetes on-site, and many commercial and open source applications
support or even require some form of Kubernetes as their deployment environment.

In addition to the core Kuberentes components, there are many supporting technologies that are
typically used to support a Kubernetes environment.   These technologies include:

* Docker
* Kubernetes
* Rancher
* ArgoCD
* Helm

## Overview Training

This content is intended to provide a collection of brief videos which provide a general overview
of each technology.  The intent is to give viewers enough information to do additional research
and investigation on their own.  Here are the minimum recommended videos:
