# Kubernetes Training

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) is a platform for for deploying and managing containerized
applications.  Many cloud vendors such as Amazon, Google, and Microsoft provide Kubernetes as a
service, allowing software to be deployed in a consistent way across multiple environments.  It
is also possible to deploy Kubernetes on-site, and many commercial and open source applications
support or even require some form of Kubernetes as their deployment environment.

In addition to the core Kuberentes components, there are many supporting technologies that are
typically used to support a Kubernetes environment.   These technologies include:

* Docker
* Kubernetes
* Rancher
* ArgoCD
* Helm
